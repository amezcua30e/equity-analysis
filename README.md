# equity-analysis
This was a group project for my corporate finance class. In here, along with my classmates, we performed a thorough review of the retail industry. We calculate the WACC, cost of equity, etc. We also provided an outlook of the stock for the next 5-10 years. I was mainly responsible for Walmart while also writing the industry outlook paragraph.
